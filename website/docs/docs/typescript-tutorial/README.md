# Typescript Tutorial

This section will guide you through integrating and using Typescript with Easy Peasy. It will start with the basics, focusing on state only, and then introduce each of the APIs (e.g. an [action](/docs/api/action), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk), etc) as it proceeds.

> **Note:** this section is a work in progress. I will be updating it as I get through it. Hopefully within a week it will be fairly complete. I appreciate your patience.

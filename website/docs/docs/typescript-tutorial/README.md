# Typescript Tutorial

This section will guide you through integrating and using Typescript with Easy Peasy. It will start with the basics, focusing on state only, and then introduce each of the APIs (e.g. an [action](/docs/api/action), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk), etc) as it proceeds. 

We will be building a fully functional application along the way, using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) to host the demo. Each section will link to a specific [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) instance with the progress that we have made.

If you aren't familiar with Easy Peasy then I would recommend that you first familiarise yourself with it by reading the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial). This Typescript tutorial will not go into detail regarding the APIs.

> **Note:** this section is a work in progress. I will be updating it as I get through it. Hopefully within a week it will be fairly complete. I appreciate your patience.
